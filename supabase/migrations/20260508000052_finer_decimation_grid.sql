-- Tighten the zoom-decimation grid by 4× across the board.
-- Migration 50 was conservative (40m at zoom 13, 5m at zoom 16) —
-- visually that's a big chunk of dropped pins for areas where
-- trees are 5-15m apart. The user wants more individual pins to
-- be visible, accepting some visual touching/overlap on screen
-- as long as we drop pins at literally the same pixel.
--
-- New cell sizes (meters → degrees ÷ 111320):
--   zoom 12: 0.00018  (≈20m)
--   zoom 13: 0.00009  (≈10m)
--   zoom 14: 0.000045 (≈5m)
--   zoom 15: 0.0000225 (≈2.5m)
--   zoom 16: 0.0000113 (≈1.25m)
--   zoom 17+: 0       (no decimation)
--
-- A pin's marker is ~12px on screen. At zoom 13, 1px ≈ 14m at
-- 42° latitude, so 12px ≈ 168m. With a 10m grid, roughly 17
-- pins per pin-circle on screen — heavy visual overlap, but
-- every pin that's at a *distinct* coordinate gets drawn rather
-- than dropped.
